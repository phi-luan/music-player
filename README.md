# Music Player

This is a personal project aimed at practicing core JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I designed a music player featuring locally downloaded mp3 files and album cover images (png). The player includes functionalities for displaying song lyrics and the upcoming songs in the playlist.

## Features

- **Play, Pause, Next, Previous**: Basic music controls to navigate through the playlist.
- **Shuffle and Repeat**: Options to shuffle the playlist or repeat songs.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume with a slider and toggle mute.
- **Favorite Songs**: Mark songs as favorites and manage a list of favorite songs.
- **Lyrics Display**: Show lyrics for the current song.
- **Upcoming Songs**: Display the list of songs that will play next.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality and dynamic content updates.
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the player.
- **CSS**: For styling the player interface and adding transitions.
